# Figma Dev Mode exporting to Aphrodite (styling engine)

This Figma plugin was made to streamline front end styling work, with quick copy-paste for Aphrodite. It can also be customized to connect Figma variables to your own codebase's styling values (color, size, position... etc.) It functions in `Dev Mode,` replacing the default CSS output with an Aphrodite object.
